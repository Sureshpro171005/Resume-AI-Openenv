# 🚀 AI Resume Optimizer

An AI-powered system that **automatically improves resumes step-by-step** to better match job descriptions using intelligent optimization and scoring.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many job seekers struggle to tailor their resumes for specific roles, leading to low ATS (Applicant Tracking System) scores and missed opportunities.

---

## 💡 Solution

This project introduces an **AI Resume Optimization Agent** that:

* Analyzes a resume against job requirements
* Applies intelligent improvements
* Tracks progress using a scoring system
* Visualizes improvement through a graph

---

## 🧠 Key Features

* ✅ Step-by-step resume optimization
* 📊 Score tracking (Initial → Final + improvement %)
* 📈 Graph visualization of improvement
* 💡 Explainable AI (why score improved)
* 🎨 Clean and modern UI (Gradio)
* 🔁 Reproducible environment (OpenEnv-style)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Load a sample resume and job description
2. Calculate initial similarity score
3. Apply optimization actions:

   * Add relevant skills
   * Improve experience
   * Optimize keywords
4. Recalculate score after each step
5. Display:

   * Final optimized resume
   * Improvement percentage
   * Step-by-step changes
   * Score improvement graph

---

## 📊 Example Output

* Initial Score: `0.36`
* Final Score: `0.40 (+11%)`
* Improvement explained with actions
* Visual graph of score progression

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

* Python
* Gradio (UI)
* Matplotlib (Graph visualization)
* Custom similarity scoring (NLP-based logic)
